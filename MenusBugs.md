# Menus Bug Report

-----------------------

## Survival Menu

### /bank

-- The /bank portion is disabled/is not functional. Game states that the command is unknown and it seems as though it is just the command, this includes the icon in the survival menu being disabled due to it running the same in-game command even when I try to type it in manually I still get the Same error. (07/02/25)

## /jobs

-- The Jobs "LumberJack", "Miner", "Builder", "Craftsman", "Excavator", " " Does not payout to the player in any capacity, and doesnt seem to be working properly. The /Jobs menu works, the /jobs info panel works, and I can even select a job. But the money that should be being earned from that job is not being given to the player.  (07/02/25)
