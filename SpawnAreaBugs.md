# Spawn Area Bug Report

---------------------

## Crates

-- There is no "Common Crate" to be found inside the /warp Crates area, the chest sprite is there for the Common Crate, But it does nothing, I cant not preview the crate in anyway nor use a crate key on it either since the sprite just doesn't exists. ~ Sent (07/02/25 @ 6:35pm{EST}) - By: KS43

## Spawn

-- The Starter Kit Build Chest is sitting in the spawn block, which could possibly cause issues later down the line, not 100% sure on that part though. ~ Sent (07/02/25 @ 6:35pm{EST}) - By: KS43
