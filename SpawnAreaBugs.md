# Spawn Area Bug Report
---------------------
## Crates
-- There is no "Common Crate" or "Tags Crate" to be found inside the /warp Crates area, the chest sprite is there for the Common Crate, But it does nothing, I cant not preview the crate in anyway nor use a crate key on it either since the sprite just doesn't exists. (07/02/25)

## Spawn
-- The Starter Kit Build Chest is sitting in the spawn block, which could possibly cause issues later down the line, not 100% sure on that part though. (07/02/25)
